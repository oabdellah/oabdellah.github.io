										<h3>Creating the Dispensing Mechanism</h3>
										<h4>Solenoid Valves</h4>
									</header>
									<p>One of the most important parts of the mechanical system was finding the most efficient and inexpensive pumps to use.</p>
									<p>
										Over the course of this project, the team put much thought into the best way to transport water/fluid from our 2L bottles 
                                        to the cup. At the start of the project, we thought that solenoid valves were the best option, especially since they could 
                                        be controlled easily through the Arduino. However, after purchasing and testing the valves, we found that the flow rate was 
                                        much too slow for our purposes. Additionally, due to the pressure requirement of solenoids, we were worried that the liquid 
                                        would stop flowing once the volume decreased to a certain amount. Overall, we decided to pivot to using peristaltic pumps 
                                        after taking the following into consideration: the flow rate; the orientation of the solenoids on the bottles; and the ease 
                                        of integration with the overall system.

											<h4>Peristaltic Pumps</h4>
										</header>
										<p>
											After much time searching for alternatives, we found that peristaltic pumps would be the easiest to integrate with the 
                                            rest of the mechanical and electrical setup we had. Peristaltic pumps hold liquid by pinching the tube and dispense liquid 
                                            by releasing pressure on the tube. Our pumps require 12V, so we were able to buy a 12V power supply to share between our 
                                            four peristaltic pumps. Ultimately, we decided that the peristaltic pumps were a much better option, as they proved to be 
                                            less expensive, have a great non-pressurized flow rate, and were very easy to integrate.

											<h3>Peristaltic Pump Mounts</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											In order to hold the dispensing mechanism in place, we needed a way to secure the peristaltic pumps. 
											The pump mounts are perfectly fitted and are screwed into place with the help of heat-set inserts. 
											Thanks to the lightweight pumps only requiring a single screw to secure the mounts, these allowed for a modular design. 
											It was very easy to move things around as necessary, and made mounting the four pumps very simple. 
											There is also the ability to screw into three more surfaces of the pump for additional stability and movement control. 
											The design of the mount also makes it much easier to disassemble in order to clean or change pumps.
